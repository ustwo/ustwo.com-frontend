We kept our ambition with Moodnotes laser-focused – to design, build and test a minimum viable product with a unique value proposition to launch in the market within 10 weeks.</p> <p>Our product vision helped frame our thinking from the outset:</p> <blockquote><p><em>To create a smart journaling tool to help people develop healthier thinking habits.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This statement became the focus for every feature we generated and every decision we made about the application. Through continual rounds of product development, user validation and learning we co-created an experience which benefits people not only when they&#8217;re feeling down, but also when they&#8217;re feeling up. At each stage, Edrick and Drew helped to keep us on course to create an app that was tailored to improving people’s thinking habits and emotional health.</p> ",

So before taking the app to market we wanted to carry out a beta trial to get additional feedback and double-check some of our assumptions. With a few tweets we were able to invite 500 people onto our trial. Out of the 1500 people who saw our landing page, 500 signed up to be part of the trial – a conversion metric that gave us further confidence in the proposition we’d created. Analytics allowed us to measure usage of the app features within our trial group and we were able to see that our retention rate was good (52% after the second week). Qualitative research helped us to understand our user needs further – their feedback shaped our prioritisation of the backlog prior to launch.</p> <p>Working fast to get a product out into the wild and in the hands of real users is always exciting – it’s the users who ensure we’re making the right decisions and spending our time creating the right features which meet their needs.</p> ",
