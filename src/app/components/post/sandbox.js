An open forum where we invite interesting profiles from the digital community to come and inspire our team &#8211; Cheng joined us to present his progressive research on mental well-being and modern technology. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For years, Cheng struggled with overwhelming stress and anxiety, to the point where it was affecting his work. Deciding to take matters into his own hands, quite literally, he began practicing ancient Tai Chi and mindfulness to change his destructive patterns. With a background in interaction design, he subsequently saw the opportunity of combining these techniques with modern technology. Using the slow, continuous movements of Tai Chi to anchor attention onto our phone and away from our negative thoughts – making our portable devices a tool for relaxation. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Teaching himself to program for iOS, he came back to us with a simple prototype – using a black screen and audio feedback – and we were immediately excited to use our digital product capabilities and turn it into a great digital product. Partnering with Cheng and PauseAble, we wanted to create an engaging user experience for his research and a product that could actually help people to relax and reduce stress.</span></p>\n",

We knew the focus lied in the slow, continuous movement of one’s fingertip on the mobile screen. A simple – yet powerful – exchange which triggers the body’s ‘rest and digest’ response, allowing a user to regain focus and release stress in minutes. </p>\n<p>We needed to create something that just about anyone would be able to pick up and experience the value of themselves, with little or no instruction. We allowed quite fluid role definitions to take on full advantage of the hybrid skill-set in the team, and having the client on site also helped a lot. Working on PAUSE became constantly trying things out through open exploration, rapid prototyping and rigorous testing. Using Unity, we were able to constantly test our designs – making live changes and prototyping our different approaches in real-time.</p>\n",

Create an experience that continuously draws the attention of the user, without seeking to occupy it fully. After some reflection and a quick round of user testing we realised we needed something beautiful and fascinating that would trigger the interaction, but in the end not needed to be seen on the screen so the user could focus on the relaxing effect of their own repetitive movements and the audio.</p>\n<p>We started out with a “realistic” design approach using a fishing float as the trigger, diving deeper into the ocean in accordance with the user’s stroking movements. Although engaging and beautiful, there were some pieces that didn’t fit. It felt heavy where it should have been aerial, made of subtle nuances, which bring the scent of mystery that usually surrounds meditation. On top of this, the colours were garish when we needed them to be soft and silky.</p>\n<p>Keeping with the idea of the sinking object, we focused on experimenting with a more colourful but soft contemporary illustration style. We turned the ocean into colour gradients and the float into different shapes such as an iceberg, crystals or Escher’s impossible shapes experimenting with the soothing experience of Monument Valley. During this process, we naturally deviated from the concept of sinking to a floating feeling as it was conveying a more positive image, and more in line with people’s expectations of a meditative and relaxing experience. Last but not least, we wanted to analyse how much of a difference it would make to users’ concentration level not to darken the screen.</p>\n",

The bubble of air floating in water combined with our randomly displayed gradients provided the right atmosphere for PAUSE.</p>\n<p>We drafted up various versions, making sure they were overlaying properly with our coloured backgrounds. We also produced some pieces of motion to get the right feeling for our shape, as we wanted something organic, random, floating around and dancing along with your finger. We finally ended with the UI in PAUSE, keeping it as minimalistic and airy as possible not to overwhelm users.</p>\n",

Venturing into the unknown and creating something never seen before, it became very important to stay critical while interpreting the different data types. Not only did we want create a simple and engaging solution, we wanted to make sure it actually worked – looking at both qualitative and quantitative data throughout the different phases.</p>\n<p>The initial tests were conducted on participants wearing a Muse brain sensor headband to sensor brain activity while trying out different concepts for 10 minutes, and following up with interviews. Testing the final concept, which is now released in PAUSE, the brain signals clearly showed the participants’ minds changed from an active state to a calmer state when using the app. They also sustained the calmness throughout the session.</p>\n<p>To further evaluate PAUSE’s ability to calm the active mind, we set out to conduct a scientific study using an Emotiv wireless headset to measure EEG-signals. To validate the data from these sessions, we collaborated with Dr. Chi Thanh Vi, Human-Computer Interaction researcher at the University of Sussex. Chi Thanh Vi is an expert in using brain sensing methods to understand the neural basis of different user states when using interactive products. With his analysis, we could interpret the data and show that PAUSE helps to produce a calmer state of mind and a lower mental workload.</p>\n",

We have taken something as intangible as a philosophy and turned it into something concrete that basically anyone can interact with. </p>\n<p>With PAUSE we’re happy to have created a tool where people can experience the benefits of Tai Chi and mindfulness in a few minutes rather than months or years of dedicated training. We’re very proud to release a product that hopefully can make a positive difference in people’s lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/141524766\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"PAUSE by ustwo + PauseAble &ndash; Relaxation at your fingertip\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>PAUSE – Relaxation at your fingertip is out now for iOS.<br /> <a href=\"http://us2.co/pauseapp\" target=\"_blank\">Download on the App Store</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Selected press:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/10/beautiful-new-app-like-stress-relieving-lava-lamp/\" target=\"_blank\">WIRED</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hypebeast.com/2015/10/pause-iphone-app\" target=\"_blank\">Hypebeast</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/pause-ustwo/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3052005/an-iphone-app-to-help-you-relax-designed-around-brainwaves-and-tai-chi\" target=\"_blank\">FastCo</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/08/and-it-works/\" target=\"_blank\">The Next Web</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.techinsider.io/pause-meditation-app-by-ustwo-2015-10 http://uk.businessinsider.com/pause-meditation-app-by-ustwo-2015-10\" target=\"_blank\">Tech Insider</a></p>\n",
