An open forum where we invite interesting profiles from the digital community to come and inspire our team &#8211; Cheng joined us to present his progressive research on mental well-being and modern technology. </p> <p class="p1">For years, Cheng struggled with overwhelming stress and anxiety, to the point where it was affecting his work. Deciding to take matters into his own hands, quite literally, he began practicing ancient Tai Chi and mindfulness to change his destructive patterns. With a background in interaction design, he subsequently saw the opportunity of combining these techniques with modern technology. Using the slow, continuous movements of Tai Chi to anchor attention onto our phone and away from our negative thoughts – making our portable devices a tool for relaxation. </p> <p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Teaching himself to program for iOS, he came back to us with a simple prototype – using a black screen and audio feedback – and we were immediately excited to use our digital product capabilities and turn it into a great digital product. Partnering with Cheng and PauseAble, we wanted to create an engaging user experience for his research and a product that could actually help people to relax and reduce stress.</span></p> ',

We knew the focus lied in the slow, continuous movement of one’s fingertip on the mobile screen. A simple – yet powerful – exchange which triggers the body’s ‘rest and digest’ response, allowing a user to regain focus and release stress in minutes. </p> <p>We needed to create something that just about anyone would be able to pick up and experience the value of themselves, with little or no instruction. We allowed quite fluid role definitions to take on full advantage of the hybrid skill-set in the team, and having the client on site also helped a lot. Working on PAUSE became constantly trying things out through open exploration, rapid prototyping and rigorous testing. Using Unity, we were able to constantly test our designs – making live changes and prototyping our different approaches in real-time.</p> ",

Create an experience that continuously draws the attention of the user, without seeking to occupy it fully. After some reflection and a quick round of user testing we realised we needed something beautiful and fascinating that would trigger the interaction, but in the end not needed to be seen on the screen so the user could focus on the relaxing effect of their own repetitive movements and the audio.</p> <p>We started out with a “realistic” design approach using a fishing float as the trigger, diving deeper into the ocean in accordance with the user’s stroking movements. Although engaging and beautiful, there were some pieces that didn’t fit. It felt heavy where it should have been aerial, made of subtle nuances, which bring the scent of mystery that usually surrounds meditation. On top of this, the colours were garish when we needed them to be soft and silky.</p> <p>Keeping with the idea of the sinking object, we focused on experimenting with a more colourful but soft contemporary illustration style. We turned the ocean into colour gradients and the float into different shapes such as an iceberg, crystals or Escher’s impossible shapes experimenting with the soothing experience of Monument Valley. During this process, we naturally deviated from the concept of sinking to a floating feeling as it was conveying a more positive image, and more in line with people’s expectations of a meditative and relaxing experience. Last but not least, we wanted to analyse how much of a difference it would make to users’ concentration level not to darken the screen.</p> ",

We thought that instead of darkening the screen we could give users additional objectives such as re-assemble a cube, playing with masks, Russian dolls or playing with a kaleidoscope type effect.</p> <p>After a few talks with our devoted testers, it became clear that we needed something aerial, a tad poetic, which would provide users with a seamless but new experience each session – and found that in a spirit level. The bubble of air floating in water combined with our randomly displayed gradients provided the right atmosphere for PAUSE.</p> <p>We drafted up various versions, making sure they were overlaying properly with our coloured backgrounds. We also produced some pieces of motion to get the right feeling for our shape, as we wanted something organic, random, floating around and dancing along with your finger. We finally ended with the UI in PAUSE, keeping it as minimalistic and airy as possible not to overwhelm users.</p> ",

Not only did we want create a simple and engaging solution, we wanted to make sure it actually worked – looking at both qualitative and quantitative data throughout the different phases.</p> <p>The initial tests were conducted on participants wearing a Muse brain sensor headband to sensor brain activity while trying out different concepts for 10 minutes, and following up with interviews. Testing the final concept, which is now released in PAUSE, the brain signals clearly showed the participants’ minds changed from an active state to a calmer state when using the app. They also sustained the calmness throughout the session.</p> <p>To further evaluate PAUSE’s ability to calm the active mind, we set out to conduct a scientific study using an Emotiv wireless headset to measure EEG-signals. To validate the data from these sessions, we collaborated with Dr. Chi Thanh Vi, Human-Computer Interaction researcher at the University of Sussex. Chi Thanh Vi is an expert in using brain sensing methods to understand the neural basis of different user states when using interactive products. With his analysis, we could interpret the data and show that PAUSE helps to produce a calmer state of mind and a lower mental workload.</p> ",

We are connected anywhere at any time, virtually to anyone, and soon enough to anything on the planet. It is remarkable, enriching and empowering. But it would really be a shame if we start to lose sight of the deeper values which make us human, and forget to keep in touch with ourselves. We know that entertainment and consumption can give us temporary pleasure, but what truly makes us happy is that we have the energy to take responsibilities, the capacity to choose wisely and have the presence for the relationships we truly cherish.</p> <p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Many people complain it is the constant connectivity and continuous stimulations provided by modern technology that has made us more </span>stressed,<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> and become less concentrated. Recent research unveiled the average attention span for a human being in 2015 is 8 seconds, which is 1 second less than that of a goldfish [1]. We can see our vulnerability to the super seductive technology we have created. It makes us feel the experience provided by our devices are always more important and interesting than what is happening in the here and now. This can make us continuously miss the most fundamental dimension of our life: our family, our responsibilities, and our immediate surroundings. </span></p> <p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9071" src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2015/10/3_goldfish-1024x576.png" alt="3_goldfish" width="1024" height="576" /></p>',

One study states an average person thinks 65000 thoughts per day, and 95% of the thoughts are the same from the day before [4]. Yet another study reported that 80% of everyone’s thoughts contain some sort of negative content [5]. To avoid this uncomfortable condition, we are naturally eager to fill our mind with whatever information is readily available [2], that give us something to distract our attention away from our uncomfortable inner state. </p> <p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">This condition makes us become very vulnerable to the attractive entertainment and exciting new experiences.

William James, one of the founding father of modern psychology stated: “The faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again, is the very root of judgment, character, and will. No one is compose sui if he have it not. An education which should improve this faculty would be the education par excellence. But it is easier to define this ideal than to give practical instructions for bringing it about.” [6]. </p> <p class="p1">The ability of voluntarily paying attention allows us to effectively disengage with external and internal distractions, stressful thoughts and worries, and able to focus our attention to what is truly important. The constant stimulations and connectivity in everyday life easily captures and manipulates our attention, and makes us often forget our innate capacity of controlling attention from moment to moment, which is at core of our happiness and well-being. The ability of voluntarily paying attention is a skill can be cultivated, and traditionally only cultivated through contemplative practises such as mindfulness meditation.</p> <p class="p1">What if interactive technology enables a totally new way can help us cultivate this crucial inner skill of paying attention at will?</p> <p dir="ltr " style="line-height: 1.38;margin-top: 0 pt;margin-bottom: 0 pt;"> </p> ',

These kind of movements require focus on the movement journey itself – from moment to moment – in order to sustain. This way the bodily movement anchors attention in the body and the movement itself, and holds attention away from the often negative and repetitive thoughts that make us stressful. </p> <p class="p2">Digital experience design often borrows useful elements from physical life experiences. Examples such as the rubberband effects and kinetic scrolling on smartphones are all great examples of how we can extract interaction qualities from daily experiences and apply them creatively into digital design.</p> <p class="p2">Combining the insights above enabled us to realise that we can extract the slow, continuous and gentle movement quality from the precise forms and patterns of Tai Chi, and apply it when designing interactions for digital products. In this way, the movement becomes the vessel of our current attention, which enables our technology to detect attention in a very simple and practical way. At the same time, our devices can provide engaging yet non-stimulative feedback to reflect the person’s focused attention, which motivates the person to keep performing the slow, continuous and gentle bodily movements for a longer period of time and achieve calm and focus.</p> <p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9072 " src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2015/10/6_a-better-life-1024x576.png" alt="A totally new approach for designing for mental well-being" width="1024" height="576" /></p> ',

A core element of mindfulness meditation</strong></p> <p>With substantial amount of scientific evidence of it’s effectiveness on stress reduction and treating diseases, mindfulness meditation is widely accepted and practised by many people, and become integrated into mainstream medicine. [6] One of the key elements of mindfulness meditation is the person voluntarily direct and sustain attention onto a specific object, for example the breath, feeling of the body or any physical object. The moment we become aware our attention has wandered away, we voluntarily bring the attention back to the object, again and again without judgment. In this way it gradually develops the familiarity with our own attention.</p> <p>In our approach the specific object for attention is the slow, continuous and gentle bodily movements. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. Attention restoration process (Psychology)</strong></p> <p>Professor Stephen Kaplan from University of Michigan proposed two mandates underlying different attention restorative processes: 1) Avoid calling on tired cognitive patterns, by being away from everyday environment. 2) Avoid unnecessary effort. Running a single cognitive map for an extended period of time is ideal for attention restoration <span style="line-height:1.5;">[9]</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">.</span></p> <p>In our approach, we may use digital design to create beautiful ambient audio, visual environment which is both engaging and yet non-stimulating to our mind. The slow, continuous and gentle bodily movements gives user a single cognitive map, which does not cost user’s cognitive effort unnecessarily. Importantly, the rewarding digital experiences is only available to user when technology detects user’s focused attention, through the slow, continuous and gentle movements. In this way the digital experience gives meaning to the act of focused attention, which motivates user to keep going for an extended period of time.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. The Relaxation response (Physiology)</strong></p> <p>Professor Herbert Benson from Harvard Medical School, introduced the discovery of the relaxation response in 1975. The relaxation response, counteracts the stress response, is a coordinated physiological response characterised by decreased arousal, diminished heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure, in association with a state of “well-being” <span style="line-height: 1.5;">[11]</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">. An essential aspect is that the relaxation response can be elicited by anyone, it is a self-regulative process. </span></p> <p>There are only two elements required to elicit the relaxation response. 1) the person direct and pay attention to the repetition of a word, sound, phrase, prayer, or muscular activity. 2) passively disregarding everyday thoughts that inevitably come to mind and returning to your repetition <span style="line-height: 1.5;">[10]</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">.</span></p> <p>In our approach, we build upon the repetitive muscular activity by using slow, continuous and gentle muscular movements as the object of attention. When user being distracted by everyday thoughts, it becomes difficult to sustain the focused movements, which can be easily detected by technology. We may design the digital experience to remind the user to bring attention back to the focused movements again and again, to trigger the relaxation response in the body.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4. Augmented Self-regulation (Interaction Design)</strong></p> <p>Neema Moraveji, director of Calming technology lab from Stanford University, suggested that the problem of susceptibility to chronic stress can be approached as a problem of inadequate self-regulation. In his doctoral dissertation he examined how technology can augment one&#8217;s respiratory self-regulation process, to encourage the development of one&#8217;s own self-regulation system [11].</p> <p>In our approach, we introduce slow, continuous and gentle bodily movements as an alternative form of self-regulation, which allow us to integrate the Augmented self-regulation theory into daily interactions with digital products.</p> <p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9074 " src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2015/10/5_four-pillars-1024x576.png" alt="Four pillars image" width="1024" height="576" /></p>',

Some of us even do it regularly and probably think that we are good at it. Even though that might be the case, it doesn’t change the fact that it’s still a dangerous endeavour that puts us and others at risk. </p> <p>Unfortunately, phone use while driving is a behavior almost as common as driving itself. Which is why we, a group of students in the <a href="http: //mhcid.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Masters in Human Computer Interaction + Design program at University of Washington</a>, decided to address this problem as part of our capstone project, in partnership with the ustwo auto team in London. The recent success of the ustwo thought piece on tackling the redesign of the car instrument cluster, and the widespread media attention it received, made them a perfect partner for such a project. </p> <p>A <a href="https://www.aaafoundation.org/measuring-cognitive-distractions" target="_blank">six-year study by the AAA Foundation</a> (American Automobile Association) rated in-car activities of thousands of US teen drivers (talking to passengers, adjusting the radio, phone use etc.). The most prevalent distraction was other passengers, followed by phone use. Phone use is very distracting because it takes the driver’s hands off the wheel, eyes off the road and mind off the task of driving. While <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.471419289592205.1073741828.214710018596468&#038;type=3" target="_blank">there are numerous reasons why texting and driving is dangerous</a>, the single statistic that stands out the most is that there is on an average of <a href="https://www.aaafoundation.org/sites/default/files/2015TeenCrashCausationFS.pdf" target="_blank">one teen death per day in the United States alone, which can be directly attributed to cellphone use while driving</a>.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-8887 size-small aligncenter" src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2015/09/Texting-and-Driving-three-607x480.jpg" alt="Texting and driving facts" width="607" height="480" /></p> ',

          value: '<p>The question then is why is this such a prevalent problem? We found a nationally recognized expert in research on distracted driving at University of Washington, <a href="http: //depts.washington.edu/hfsm/linda.php" target="_blank">Dr. Linda Ng Boyle</a>. She runs the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/hfsm/" target="_blank">Human Factors and Statistical Modeling Lab</a>, home to numerous studies conducted on distracted driving. We spoke with her and read many of her papers and learned several things – most importantly that people genuinely believe they are better drivers than they really are, and that multitasking while driving is less safe than some might think. Another piece of valuable information was that status indicators and feedback are very important for improving a person’s situational awareness.</p> <p>We next researched existing products that attempt to deal with texting while driving. We looked at the pipeline of a text message (from origin to delivery) in the context of driving, and mapped some of the existing solutions to each step in this process. <strong>We realized that all existing solutions are oriented towards altering the behavior of the driver</strong>, by blocking phone use altogether or providing alternate ways to operate your phone (HUDs, in-dash displays etc.). </p> <p>In today’s day and age, digital communication has invaded every aspect of our lives. Every notification received on our devices triggers an involuntary reaction to check and take an action immediately, or at the very least a glance. Considering this, we realized that any solution that discourages, prohibits or blocks drivers from this behavior is a forced solution that will probably not be successful in the longer run. The in-car solutions that give you access to your phone’s functions through mounted screens or HUDs do not really eliminate distraction &#8211; at best they only reduce it by a little bit. So we asked ourselves, instead of trying to change the driver’s behavior, can we shift some of the responsibility of safer texting away from the driver? How do we design an intervention that focuses on using the sender as the filter instead?</p> <p><em><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8948" src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2015/09/Competitive-Analysis-1024x562.png" alt="text pipeline" width="1024" height="562" />Analysis of existing products and how they map to the text messaging pipeline in the context of driving</em></p>',

We also asked whether knowing that their recipient was driving might change their texting behavior, or alter their expectations of that interaction. Of the 10 texters, 8 said that they do not think of the receiver’s context prior to texting. When asked if they would continue to message if they knew that the recipient was driving at that time, 5 said they would not. In later user testing however, this percentage turned out to be much higher. Armed with this little bit of validation we set out to design a solution that leverages people’s concern of others’ safety to promote a safer driving behavior. </p> <p>The interaction model we designed for our solution can be implemented on any mobile operating system and any messaging platform. However, for the sake of our implementation timeframe, we decided to constrain our implementation to iOS, and use iMessage as the platform.</p> <p>The solution we designed is called <strong>Car Mode</strong>. It is much like Airplane Mode, except that it does not need a flight attendant to remind you to turn it on. The beauty of Car Mode is that it is totally automatic after a one-time bluetooth pairing of the car with the phone. After the pairing, every time the user starts the car, the bluetooth connection is made and Car Mode is engaged – the driver doesn’t have to do anything. </p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8965 size-medium " src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2012/09/Interaction-Model-v3-566x768.png" alt="Interaction Model" width="566" height="768" /></p> ',

This forces the sender to consider the context and adjust expectations accordingly while composing the message. The sender may even decide not to message at all. Senders can override this deferred notification if they think that the message is important enough. Adding this extra step to override the default behavior discourages users from circumventing the system constantly. Important messages are relayed to the driver while driving through Siri. This is the least distracting method of message delivery, because it leaves the driver’s hands on the wheel, and eyes on the road. To protect driver privacy, Car mode can be configured such that only a selected group of contacts have visibility of the driving status.</p> ',

For the sender side of the equation, we built paper prototypes of the iPhone screens and put them in front of 20 testing participants within our target age group of 18-24. All our testers saw and understood the red microtext notification. </p> <p>After seeing the deferred notification, of the 20 participants, 9 said they would use the default behavior and send the text message with deferred notification, 8 said they just wouldn’t text at all until later, 2 said they would send now but make their message shorter and expect no return message for awhile, and 1 said he would send now with no change.</p> <p>We also tested the solution with “drivers” in the driving simulator housed in the University of Washington’s Human Factors and Statistical Modeling Lab. We put 5 participants within our target age range (18-24) through a 30 minute process &#8211; 5 minutes of general questions about their texting habits, 20 minutes in the simulator, and 5 minutes of wrap up questions. While using the simulator, we first sent them a message on their own phone, to see actual practice of their current behavior of receiving a text while driving. We then gave them a prepared iPhone with an interactive prototype, and noted their reactions to 1) Car Mode turning on, 2) a forced message coming through while driving (delivered via Siri), and 3) deferred notifications showing up on the phone after they stopped driving.</p> <p>Drivers understood that messages that came through while driving were time dependent and relevant to their driving situation. Deferred messages were interpreted as less important and more social in nature. Without being informed that it was the sender who was determining urgency of the message, our drivers were curious what “magic” was behind the system’s ability to filter the important texts from the trivial ones.</p> <blockquote><p><em>“The messages in the car were about our plans, the deferred ones were just saying hi.”</em></p> <p><em>“I like how it filters the important stuff from the noise. How does it do that?”</em></p> <p><em>“It doesn&#8217;t tempt you. It waits until you&#8217;re out of the car.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>It became clear to us that users need to understand both the driver and sender sides of the Car Mode equation to fully understand the product. Even though we believe that the concepts are simple and easy to grasp, it was surfaced that a short tutorial or onboarding experience might be a great addition to provide more details to the curious user. Users liked the product and how it reflected their natural filtering behavior. We observed that each user has his/her own way to perform text “triage”, determining whether the sender or the topic is worth dealing with right away, or waiting until later.</p> <p> </p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8968 size-medium " src="https: //usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2012/09/User-Evaluation-and-Testing-1024x576.png" alt="User Evaluation and Testing" width="1024" height="576" /></p>',

However, the underlying interaction model can be easily modified to work with regular text messages using an auto reply option. Senders on a non iOS platform receive an automatic response to their text with instructions to force send the message. This ensures that the solution works in all scenarios. </p> <p><strong>Handling calls while driving</strong></p> <p>The solution currently focuses only on the texting while driving aspect of phone use. However, it can be easily extended to handle incoming phone calls. All calls received while Car Mode is on are diverted to voicemail. An alternate greeting replaces the standard outgoing message for the duration of the drive. As with text messages, Siri can be used to alert the driver and playback voicemails without the driver having to take their eyes off the road.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8969 size-medium " src="https: //usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2012/09/Extending-car-mode-856x768.png" alt="Extending car mode" width="856" height="768" /></p> <p><em>Left: Settings for handling calls with Car Mode</em></p> <p><em>Right: Compatibility with regular text messages for non iOS senders</em></p> ',

It uses existing technology and leverages human traits of empathy and concern to drive a positive change. The solution does not arm-twist users into altering their behavior &#8211; instead it handles and/or delegates the responsibility of filtering text messages to the device when driving. The fact that it mirrors existing responsible user behavior,  i.e. screening for important messages and asking someone else to reply on your behalf, if required, makes the solution a prime example of a user centered design.</p> <p>We strongly feel that making the solution an OS level feature is the surest and easiest way to ensure a widespread adoption. At a time when all apps and services are pushing to be more context aware, providing access to the user’s driving status (much like how permissions for location access work right now) can serve as a useful data point to trigger contextual behaviors. It would be interesting to see how other apps might use this knowledge of context to add to the user experience. For example, navigation and music player apps could create contextual UIs that provide bigger buttons, enable voice commands, and remove non essential elements if the user is driving. Digital Assistants (Siri, Cortana, M, Google Now etc.) could use this information to take over and automate certain tasks to ensure that you can focus on the task of driving. The possibilities are endless.</p> <p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8940 " src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2015/09/Team-Photo-1024x768.jpg" alt="Team Photo" width="1024" height="768" /><em>From Left to Right: Cheryl Wang (UW), Zhenxi Mi (UW), Acacio Domar (UW), Chris Olsen (UW), Tim Smith (ustwo), David Mingay (ustwo), Rohan </em><i>Kharbanda</i><em style="line-height: 1.5;"> (UW)</em></p> <p><strong>A word of thanks:</strong></p> <p>We would like to thank the ustwo auto team – Harsha Vardhan, Tim Smith and David Mingay – for their continued support on this project and for mentoring us through the entire process.

The use of agile methods in product development is well-known, and common practice, for many in our industry but when it comes to working with larger clients we face particular challenges in adopting and adapting ways of working.</p> <p>We tempted people away from one of the last warm summer evenings for a while with Moscow mules and Cauliflower pakora, amongst other goodies, from <a href="http://www.ginger-jar-food.com/" target="_blank">The Ginger Jar</a>.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8934 size-medium" src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2015/09/ustwo-thinks-food13-1024x683.jpg" alt="ustwo thinks food" width="1024" height="683" /></p> <p>Our four contestants, erm, panellists were Doug Nicholl, Product Lead at <a href="http://www.ford.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ford</a>; <span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a href="https://twitter.com/ewebber" target="_blank">Emily Webber</a>, an independent consultant and ex-Head of Agile at GDS; </span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Kirstin</span> Smith, Director at <a href="https://twitter.com/code_couture">Code Couture</a> and </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Sam Phillips, Head of Engineering at <a href="https://shutl.com/uk/" target="_blank">Shutl</a>.</span></p> <p>It wouldn’t have been right without a personal intro from Collin – the happiest man in agile – who chaired the rest of the debate. He told us of his experience working to implement a CRM system between 2000 and 2005 for a large financial services company. With a total spend of 120 million dollars the project was nevertheless cancelled at its final go live date. Because nobody would use it. A depressingly familiar scenario, but one that has become less common over the last 15 or so years.</p> <p>A quick poll of the audience before things got underway established that most people had either been in, or were expecting to be in, a project to bring agile methods to a large organisation. Asked whether they&#8217;d had a good experience bringing in agile, a majority of people said yes – showing that despite the challenges discussed over the evening, people in general had seen what good looks like.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8943" src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2015/09/ustwo-thinks-panel-1024x683.jpg" alt="ustwo thinks 3 panel" width="1024" height="683" /></p> <p>The panel opened with their topline view of agile – what it meant to them. Doug, relatively new to agile at Ford, felt it had “been a real eye-opener,” and particularly valued “the ability to make rapid decisions [and] to empower the team.” Emily identified two key things – communication and learning. Kirstin felt that “agile really means flexibility. You can take the elements that apply to the situation and context you’re working in.” For Sam, agile “is about feedback loops and learning. Embracing those unknowns and not trying to solve everything at the start.”</p> ',

        body: {
          name: "body",
          value: '<p>Collin introduced the idea of establishing certainty, a common sticking point with large projects, noting that large organisations tend to want –  at the outset – some clarity about what they’re going to get, and when they’re going to get it. How do you get senior stakeholders on board with this? Sam’s approach was to – if you have a team on a project for 6 months or a year – have them deliver to production from the first week or even first day. In his opinion, building trust through delivering working software well ahead of full release is key.</p> <p>Emily outlined the transition in thinking required, in a place like GDS, to move power out of government departments and to groups of people working to create things according to what users want. In terms of tying in to legacy systems and legacy bureaucracy, her experience was that bringing in small groups of people to work within the organisation, but trusted to challenge it, was one way forward.</p> <p>Kirstin talked about meeting in the middle: Running agile on her own teams but working with existing, waterfall client teams and taking a sort of ‘wagile’ approach. Running workshops at the beginning to bring stakeholders on board, decoupling the the start of the project from delivery, helped to build confidence. Doug’s past experience with a car concept would be to have a well fleshed-out idea of what the vehicle would be, up to and including the business case – and then to take this to stakeholders in order to get funding. With agile methods there’s the potential to freak people out a little bit, when they’re used to hearing this, more waterfall, kind of proposition. Showing early user feedback and insight helps to reduce that.</p> <p>Collin had the panel think about pace and quality, and how tension can creep in when teams are looking to release early. Sam’s approach was never to sacrifice user quality – even if there is ‘rubbish’ tech underneath. “You can always do less,” he said. “By taking scope off the table you can keep the quality of the smaller pieces that you have at the standard that you need.”</p> <p>In considering how to balance iterative releases with pressures to work to a roadmap, Emily suggested that “if you can create a roadmap based on delivering needs rather than features, then you’re onto a winner.” Placing user needs front and centre of a project, a key part of ustwo&#8217;s approach, came up again and again over the evening.</p> <p>The discussion moved on to look at what the most difficult challenges for senior executives to deal with are.</p> <p>Emily thought that if you&#8217;re not “bringing them along then you can&#8217;t expect them to know what you&#8217;re doing.” Change is hard, and she recognised that you&#8217;re asking a lot of some people to change their mindsets and ways of working – you need to understand that.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8944 " src="https://usweb-cdn.ustwo.com/ustwo-production/uploads/2015/09/ustwo-thinks-drinks-1024x683.jpg" alt="ustwo thinks drinks" width="1024" height="683" /></p> ',

        },
        body: {
          name: "body",
          value: '<p>A question from the audience asked whether there is sometimes a value to a very strong product owner, perhaps <span style="line-height: 1.5;">a Steve Jobs-type, who ‘knows better’ than the user and does agile prevent that value coming through? Sam&#8217;s take was that that sort of vision could help, if it&#8217;s balanced with the opinions of users. Crucially, though, getting those opinions through simply asking a user isn&#8217;t really enough – it&#8217;s important to <em>show</em> people your proposition, or product, so that they&#8217;re not simply talking about what they already know.</span></p> <p>As a follow up to that, another audience member queried the ability of users to communicate what they want, and for agile to deliver the big picture. His experience was that after a long process of including different wants and needs relevant to each sprint, people only really used 20 per cent of those in the finished product. Kirstin identified the role of, and the strength of, a product owner to maintain a macro-level picture when it&#8217;s easy to focus solely on things at the sprint level – perhaps resulting in additional, unwarranted complexity.</p> <p>Towards the end of the discussion, Collin brought things around to consider the approach when working with an organisation who might have tried agile and rejected it – what do you do when agile is a ‘dirty word’? Doug outlined the importance of the ‘newness’ of a project – saying that if “you&#8217;re using agile for something that is new, novel and unique” then you might well be given the leeway to try it.</p> <p>As the event wrapped up, Emily gave her opinion on the difference between subjective opinion and real user feedback, and how agile can give its backing to the latter. Basing decisions on user&#8217;s reactions means you can get closer to answering the question: Are you delivering the right thing?</p> <p>Overall, the evening pointed towards a very positive future for agile, with a recognition that on both ‘sides’ of the debate people need to appreciate that change takes time. Effecting a transition to agile is not easy, and entrenched views and patterns of working can be a challenge. But as companies, large and small, increasingly put the user at the heart of what they&#8217;re trying to achieve – it seems agile has an ever-increasing role to play.</p> <p>With so many organisations still being in transformation, and senior stakeholders operating under endless pressures the uncertainties of Agile are still going to create discomfort – but at ustwo we still believe it&#8217;s the most effective route to failing fast and, ultimately, delivering the product your customers wants.</p> <p>The next ustwo Thinks event will be on the evening of Wednesday 20 January at the ustwo London studio – if you like to know more, please email Nanci at events@ustwo.com.</p> <p>You can hear the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ustwo-548397157/ustwothinks-3-agile-war-stories-podcast" target="_blank">full audio of the evening&#8217;s discussion on Soundcloud here</a>.</p> ',
